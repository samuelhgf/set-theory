# Equivalence Relations

An **equivalence relation** is a binary relation in a set that is **reflexive**, **symmetric** and **transitive**.

An equivalence relation can be use to **partition** a set, yielding disjoint sub-sets called **equivalence classes**. Two elements of a set are said **equivalent** if both belong to the same equivalence class.
